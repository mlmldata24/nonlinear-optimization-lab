    "The [growth_data](growth_data) directory contains data from two phytoplankton growth experiments. In each experiment, Coscinodiscus diatoms, isolated from a station in the Amazon river plume, were grown in nutrient replete media. Files are given for two experiments. Your goal is to estimate the specific growth rate for each experiment, and to quantify the uncertainty in that parameter, based on a model for exponential growth of a popoulation $y$ with time $t$.:\n",

    "a. For each experiment, plot the fluorescence data as a function of time since the start of the experiment.\n",

    "b. For each experiment, make a plot showing the least-squares fit to the log-transformed fluorescence data.\n",
    "\n",
    "c. For each experiment, use the`curve_fit` function in the `scipy.optimize` library to fit an exponential curve to the data to obtain the specific growth rate. Use the parameters from the least squares fit to log-transformed data (obtained in part c) as a first guess.\n",
